# Interactive Story Demo

Welcome! :tada:

I've created a website that will take you on a little interactive journey.<br>
I've included a hamburger menu which links to 3 different pages (the main page, the character page, and my about page.)<br>
My form is basic and does not utilize any of the inputs. It will disappear when the button is clicked. <br><br>
*** I was struggling to get it to save values and transfer them to another page, but cookies, storage, etc. were not working. :( <br>
Originally I wanted to transfer the user input into their own character slot on the reference page, and also reference the user's name once in the story. Again, since I couldn't figure it out in time, I scrapped it. ***<br>

<p>
My pages are responsive: the form, character icons/descriptions, and the about page icons will stack on a smaller view.<br>
  The image on the about page will scale with window sizing.
