# Interactive Story Demo

Welcome! :tada:

I've created a website that will take you on a little interactive journey.<br>
I've included a hamburger menu which links to 3 different pages (the main page, the character page, and my about page.)<br>
My form is basic and does not utilize any of the inputs. It will disappear when the button is clicked.

*** I was struggling to get it to save values and transfer them to another page, but cookies, storage, etc. were not working. :( <br>
Originally I wanted to transfer the user input into their own character slot on the reference page, and also reference the user's name once in the story. Again, since I couldn't figure it out in time, I scrapped it. ***<br>

My pages are responsive: the form, character icons/descriptions, and the about page icons will stack on a smaller view.<br>
The image on the about page will scale with window sizing.
The main menu should stretch to 100% viewport width at certain window sizes.

The red story options are optional and should take you back to the original choice branch it came from.
The main endings should have an option to return to the last major decision if you want to change your ending.
Normal endings (such as leaving) should have the option to restart entirely.

It's a narrative story so it's text-heavy. I tried to keep it within manageable chunks, but it's still got a few options if you want to read all of them.

Enjoy!
