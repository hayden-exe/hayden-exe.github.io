    <p><i>"I don't want to alarm you too bad, but..."</i></p>

    <p>Mai's voice catches your attention as she finishes her task.</p>
    
    <p><i>"It's about to get really messy."</i> Her smile does little to comfort your unease.</p>
    
    <p>Kyle puts his hand on your arm and pulls you over to where he's standing by the far wall. There's a small circle of candles around his spot which you stand outside of.</p>
    
    <p><i>"I trust you, okay?"</i></p>
    
    <p>Your growing anxiety does not let up.</p>
    
    <p>Tai is drawing a smaller chalk circle around Jason, connecting his shape to the main circle with a thick line. Six more thick lines branch from the sides of the circle, making it look like some kind of abstract spider.</p>
    
    <p>The twin next to you leans over and says, <i>"You should close your eyes."</i></p>
    
    <p>The way she says it makes your whole body feel chilled. </p>
    
    <p><i>"That is, unless you'd rather switch places with him..."</i></p>

<p><a href="story_009.html">No, thanks. You close your eyes.</a></p>
