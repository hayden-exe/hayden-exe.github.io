    <p>Jason introduced himself first. He's 18 and upset that he's likely to be drafted into the war. He looks to be the oldest and also the tallest, and is clearly the only person they know who has a car. His face is sullen and he goes to talk to Kyle while everyone else chats in the meantime.</p>

    <p>Tai and Mai introduce themselves together. They're both 17 and fraternal twins. Their father was also into occult stuff before he became a doctor, which is why they're obsessed with all the weird collectibles in their attic. Tai smokes and Mai is the more social and boisterous of the two. Occasionally, Mai will speak over Tai and finish his sentences for him.</p>
    
    <p>Shawni is 16 and very close with both Tai and Mai. She mentions they're dating but doesn't clarify which one. You think she means both. She's shy and only seems to hang around them.</p>
    
    <p>Chasity is also 16 and doesn't have a lot to say to you. She says she's just here because she's bored. You sense some tension between Shawni and her, but you're not sure why. She seems to loiter on her own.</p>
    
    <p>Gregory is 18 and well-kept with glasses. He's the person they convinced to research some of the more obscure text and how to read it. He only gets along with Kyle and Jason, avoiding everyone else. When he mentions that he's skeptical of supernatural occurences, you wonder why he agreed to help.</p>
    
    <p>Kyle is the one person who ties them all together. He's friends with everyone, and there's an air of responsibility about him that makes you think he's the unofficial leader of their group. He's 17 and stockier than the rest despite his height. </p>
    
    <p>Antonio isn't here, but you've heard that he's the jokester who doesn't have many aspirations in life aside from being with his friends. His grades are failing so his parents are strict about him leaving his house.</p>
