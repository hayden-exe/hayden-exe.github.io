    <p>Everyone has gotten comfortable and Kyle opens the big tome on the chair. </p>

    <p>Silence settles. Their chattering stops and the vague sound of insects can be heard outside. It feels very still, almost like a liminal space.</p>
    
    <p>A soft breeze whorls through the empty space of the warehouse. </p>
    
    <p>Candles flicker to life and the dim light leaves a soft glow around them.</p>
    
    <p>It's easier to see now and you notice the scrawlings on the floor are actually shaped into a large circle. There's some strange symbols etched in what could be ink around the inside of the white chalk circle.</p>
    
    <p>Mai and Tai pull out containers of salt and start at the closest point of the circle and split as they cover the chalk with a thick line of the salt. </p>
    
    <p>Kyle's busy finding the right page to start on in his book.</p>
    
    <p>Gregory, Chasity, and Shawni are standing off to the side and watching.</p>
    
    <p>Jason is standing at the other end of the circle, outside of it, waiting.</p>
    
    <p>When they're done with the salt, the twins fetch chalk from their pockets and start etching more symbols along the outside of the circle. </p>
    
    <p>This is all really crazy and you look at everyone wondering what the hell is going on. Is this really what they were up to? Why did you agree to come here again?</p>
