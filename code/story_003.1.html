    <p>Kyle explains that his best friends, Tai and Mai, are heavily interested in the occult. They convinced him to check out a spooky book they found in their attic, which their father collected. </p>
    
    <p>So when they wanted to try some stuff they found in the book, they said they would need a private place to conduct their so-called research. </p>
    
    <p>Another friend of theirs knew this warehouse was empty and they started using it as a club of sorts--sneaking out at night to hang out and things of that sort.</p>
    
    <p>The candles are part of the scenery. He says it's the only reliable light they can have without electricity. Also, supernatural stuff always asks for lots of candles for some reason. </p>
