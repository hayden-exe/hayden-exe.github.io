    <p>You ask why you even need to be here for this.</p>

    <p>Kyle says they did something stupid a few months ago when summer started.</p>
    
    <p>They were messing around with this book and wanted to try out one of the summoning passages within it. </p>
    
    <p>"Stupid, right?" He laughs.</p>
    
    <p>Well, it turns out that it did do something. The chalk circle on the floor has been there since the beginning, never fading. He explains that it keeps the entity they summoned trapped to within the ring. They use the salt as an extra measure so that it can't touch them. </p>
    
    <p>Apparently, all of them have seen this entity and had different reactions. It's why Gregory agreed to research it, so they could get rid of it. That's what they were doing tonight, by the way. They're trying to banish whatever it is they called here.</p>
    
    <p><i>"Antonio's not here because... well... he's obsessed with it. It's why he's failing school and I think he'd react poorly if we told him we were going to get rid of it... so..."</i> His voice trails off, quick to move on.</p>
    
    <p><i>"This is dangerous stuff. I need to finish the verbal stuff for it to work, so I need you to make sure that happens."</i></p>
