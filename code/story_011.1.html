    <p>All you have to do is make sure Kyle finishes the passage.</p>

    <p>That's all you have to do, you remind yourself. It's not that hard.</p>
    
    <p>Then why do you feel so sleepy? So heavy in your body?</p>
    
    <p>You look down and find yourself suffering the same fate as the other two who tried to stop Antonio. Your fingers touch the darkness going through your body, but you don't really feel it. It could be the loss of your senses. Maybe it's magic. You're not sure.</p>
    
    <p>Quick and efficient, you're left to bleed out on the floor.</p>
    
    <p>You can still see Kyle, who's panicking that you're dying. His hands are shaking and the tome looks too heavy for him to hold while he's crying.</p>
    
    <p>He's forced to stumble over his chant with tears in his eyes. He tries his best to finish, but the words are mumbled in uncertainty towards the end and he throws the book away once he's done.</p>
    
    <p>It doesn't work as planned. Something went wrong. It could be the seals breaking, the fumbled chant, the botched banishment. </p>
    
    <p>The entity still dissolves into seven smaller orbs of darkness. Your vision gets blurry, but you can tell that two of them immediately enter the two girls who are left through their eyes and mouth. Assimilation with the shadows means they're effectively gone as well.</p>
    
    <p>They stare at themselves as if something new has possessed their bodies. No one is left to stop them from escaping out of the front door once they realize they're able.</p>
    
    <p>The rest hover for a few seconds before escaping through cracks in the ceilings and windows. Somewhere out in the world, those things are free...</p>
    
    <p>Kyle is the only one left in the end. Your sacrifice is a needless one, but it happens regardless of fairness.</p>
    
    <p>Something is left in the middle of the circle, which Kyle approaches and speaks to before you officially black out.</p>
    
    <p>Your body is dragged into the circle for the remnants of the entity to take. You're repurposed to give it a new body, even if it won't be the same ever again.</p>
    
    <p>You vaguely feel the sensation of being drenched to your bones. </p>
    
    <p>You won't need it once you're gone.</p>
    
    <h3>Bad End</h3> 
    <p>Kyle suffers from survivor's guilt after all of his friends die trying to banish the entity. Susceptible in his moment of weakness, the part of the entity that was left after being broken apart convinces him to help it. His motives for agreeing are unknown. Everyone is declared missing, as the warehouse is empty by the next morning with no traces of the misdoings from that night.</p>
