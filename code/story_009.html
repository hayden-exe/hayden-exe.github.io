    <p>You close your eyes and a few moments later, you hear something heavy hit the floor.</p>

    <p>Kyle starts speaking in some kind of language you don't recognize so you open your eyes in order to help him like he asked.</p>
    
    <p>Tai is standing in front of the door and you realize you can't leave. There's a lot of blood sitting inside the small circle where Jason was standing... it doesn't go past the chalky edges.</p>
    
    <p>Light brightens significantly, candle flames growing taller. A dark shadow covers the inside of the main circle, a hunched figure--easily 8 feet tall--rises from this shadow. Its entire body is draped in shadow, almost like robes, with a white, minimalistic mask sitting on the front of its bowed head facing forward. Even the true face is hidden in shrouds, hanging like tapestry from its head. Two humanoid hands are posed at its chest, black fingers steepled as if in contemplation.</p>
    
    <p>Kyle is still chanting behind you.</p>
    
    <p>Mai is behind the entity, hiding Jason's body from view.</p>
    
    <p>Chasity and Shawni clamp hands together, their tension towards each other gone and replaced by a mutual fear.</p>
