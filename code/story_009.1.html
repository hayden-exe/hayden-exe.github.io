    <p>The door behind Tai swings open and knocks him out of the way, Antonio forcing his way inside while this twin is stunned.</p>

    <p><i>"Why are you doing this?! Nobody wanted to tell me?"</i></p>
    
    <p>He's very upset and you unconsciously move yourself between him and Kyle. </p>
    
    <p>Gregory is the first to pull Antonio away from approaching the entity in the circle. Kyle's chants are starting to work their magic--if that's what it is--and the entity's form starts to become transparent around the edges.</p>
    
    <p><i>"Get your hands off me!"</i> Antonio slaps Gregory's hands away from himself.</p>
    
    <p><i>"You shouldn't be here,"</i> the skeptic replies, terse. </p>
    
    <p>Tai gathers himself and comes to help. Antonio has backed himself up towards the circle and has his arms held out as if it will help protect it. </p>
    
    <p>He's talking to himself as if he's responding to someone speaking to him, but clearly not in response to the two trying to move him.</p>
    
    <p><i>"Don't make this hard for all of us, Joker-"</i> Tai starts but is cut off by Antonio pulling a pocket knife out.</p>
    
    <p><i>"I won't hesitate."</i> There's determination in his eyes. He won't be swayed.</p>
