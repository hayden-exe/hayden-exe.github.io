<p>A ragtag group of friends, including you, has found an interesting way to spend their summer school months. You've been invited; no, forced, into attending this special event. </p>

<p>You don't know most of them. Your best friend Kyle is to blame for roping you into this excursion. You have a vague idea about what's going on.</p>

<p>The group is into occult stuff and plan to make something happen. Kyle wants you to be there for support. Whether or not you think anything will come of it doesn't matter--he's worried and you have nothing better to do anyway.</p>
