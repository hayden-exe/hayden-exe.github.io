    <p>Mai leads you by the arm over to where Jason is standing and tells him to get out of the circle and take your place by Kyle.</p>

    <p>You feel another wave of unease as you step into the small circle, Jason looking simulateneously relieved and yet mortified as he stands next to his friend.</p>
    
    <p>The candle light seems so much brighter all of a sudden, and you move to turn and ask what you have to do...</p>
    
    <p>There's a brief second where you think about how it's impossible for anyone to hear anything when you're in the middle of nowhere, in some dilapidated warehouse with a bunch of kids you barely know.</p>
    
    <p>Everything goes dark before you realize what happened.</p>
