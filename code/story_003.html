    <p>The inside of the warehouse is musty and dark. Dust filters down from the exposed rafters near the ceiling, making obvious the layer on the floor which has pathways through it from people coming in and out. </p>

    <p>Candles line the empty floor. They are clustered together in random spots, enough to keep the area dim if they were lit. It's difficult to see much else.</p>
    
    <p><i>"Shall we get started?"</i> Kyle speaks up from beside you, pulling off his backpack.</p>
    
    <p>Beams of light come in through the cracks from boarded windows. A car approaches the warehouse and for a split second you could see some white scrawlings on the floor before the light passes.</p>
    
    <p>You hear voices outside. It must be the others.</p>
