    <p>Kyle finishes the chant and closes the tome. </p>

    <p>Everyone gathers around each other and gives their condolences. </p>
    
    <p>Chasity lingers behind to pick up Antonio to take him home.</p>
    
    <p>Tai holds onto his sister, who begins crying now that it's all over. She had enough courage to do what was necessary but Jason's death weighs heavily on her. Shawni helps to comfort them both.</p>
    
    <p>Gregory tells Kyle he'll clean everything up. He's glad it's done and wants to forget about it. In truth, he knows this group has the only people he could ever talk to about this. He'll need it whether he admits it or not.</p>
    
    <p>Kyle puts a hand on your shoulder and thanks you sincerely. He apologizes for putting you in such an awful situation and promises he'll do whatever he can for you. </p>
    
    <p>Therapy might be a good start...</p>
