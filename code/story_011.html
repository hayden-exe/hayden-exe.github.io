    <p>Tai appears confident as he tries to grab the knife out of Antonio's hand but they end up fighting over it anyway. They're grappling with each other and Gregory is trying to help by grabbing Antonio's arm.</p>

    <p>Desperate, the obsessed boy stabs his friend in the gut. Tai unconsciously pushes him away, making the wound worse while putting distance between them.</p>
    
    <p>Mai rushes over to help him. Gregory gets the knife from Antonio while he's in shock over what he did. Emotions high with hasty decisions, he stabs the knife into Antonio's shoulder. He was pushed back towards the circle, however, and his shoes scuff through the protective salt.</p>
    
    <p>Almost immediately, the entity reaches through the veil of protection to grab Antonio. Both of its arms wrap around him, pulling him back into the circle with it while a vector of shadow splits from its body.</p>
    
    <p>Gregory is trying to keep Tai standing, back facing the circle, and he doesn't get to react before the solidified spike of darkness goes through both him and Tai. Mai looks mortified next to them. They both fall to the floor shortly after.</p>
    
    <p>The entity coddles the boy in its arms, speaking in hushed whispers that only he can hear. The knife in his shoulder gets covered in inky shadows which somehow stops the bleeding. </p>
    
    <p>Its hands pick him up and lift him into the curtain fall that drapes over its head. You don't quite see everything, looking back and forth between the two scenes, but Antonio seems to disappear into the thing's mouth or... whatever is under there before you can register how it happens.</p>
    
    <p>It looks towards you and you feel something creeping at the edges of your consciousness--it's trying to speak to you but you don't understand it.</p>
    
    <p>An immeasurable pressure exudes itself upon your very soul. You feel drawn in and repulsed at the same time.</p>
    
    <p>The mutterings of the chant behind you remind you of your purpose.</p>
