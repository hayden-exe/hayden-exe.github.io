    <p>You decide that this is too much and you're not the type of person to trespass in the middle of the night. </p>

    <p><i>"Wait, are you sure?"</i> Kyle sounds disappointed but he doesn't look like he's going to argue with you.</p>
    
    <p>With a nod, you wave goodbye and start walking back the way you two came: a long dirt path that disappears into a line of trees. You pass a car full of the other members of the friend group, but they don't stop for you.</p>
    
    <p>It's past 3 AM when you get to your bed. You pass out.</p>
    
    <p>You hear the news of a mysterious group suicide out where Kyle had invited you last night. 3 bodies were found and 4 are missing.</p>
    
    <p>If you're lucky, you'll forget this ever happened.</p>
    
    <p>Otherwise, the possible outcomes of that night will plague you for years to come.</p>
