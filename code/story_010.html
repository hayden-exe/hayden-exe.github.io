    <p>For once you feel a surge of confidence and you decide to intervene before anything worse happens.</p>

    <p>While the three of them are distracted, you come from the side and punch Antonio clean across the cheek. He stumbles for all of two steps before falling to the floor, knocked out.</p>
    
    <p>You and the other two share a look of surprise. You really did that to a guy with a knife. </p>
    
    <p><i>"We owe you one."</i></p>
    
    <p>The entity appears upset and clambers at the sides of its invisible cage. Its hands can not reach past the edges of the chalk and salt circle combined, leaving it to dissipate further as Kyle recites the banishing passage from the book.</p>
    
    <p>The shadows get easier to see through and start to dissolve like smoke in water. Pieces of the entity split apart from it, forming seven small bubbles of shade which float for a few moments before disappearing as well.</p>
    
    <p>Its whole body melts away into the concrete floor as if there were floorboards with cracks, leaving nothing except the ceramic mask which it had worn behind.</p>
